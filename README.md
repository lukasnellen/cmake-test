# CMake test playground

Trying out target IMPORT and EXPORT features in cmake. See if sub-projects can 
work as individual projects as well getting included from a top-level project.

**Note**: It is recommended, but not enforced, to use out-of-source builds, i.e.,
not to run `cmake` in the main project directory, using `build` and `install` 
subdirectories should work.
